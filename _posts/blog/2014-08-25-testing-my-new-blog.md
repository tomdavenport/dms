I'm a digital marketing specialist with a very fortunate background. From viral marketing of memes and all the way to behaviour design in a digital marketing funnel for some of the biggest businesses in the world, I've been at the front line of digital for long enough to learn a few useful tricks. 

## Digital marketing or development?

I might be a digital marketing specialist, but having a head for strategy doesn't stop me working on my own design and development. The best digital marketers know how to whip up a website. I'm testing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll blog generator") until I can be completely confident that it's a solid foundation for my future blog. My original blog, under my name [Tom Davenport](http://www.tomdavenport.co.uk "Tom Davenport Blog"), will live on for any non-marketing speak. But hey, Jekyll has proven so easy to put together that I may well build more stand-alone sites like this.

## A work-in-progress

This website is very much a work-in-progress. Hang tight while I fix the ropes and polish the floor, but I dare say, it's a good start.
